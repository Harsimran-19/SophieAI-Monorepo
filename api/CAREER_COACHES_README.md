# Career Coach Agents

A sophisticated career coaching system built on the same architecture as PhiloAgents, featuring specialized AI coaches with multi-user support, long-term memory, and comprehensive evaluation capabilities.

## üéØ Overview

The Career Coach Agents system provides four specialized AI coaches, each with unique expertise:

- **Career Assessment Agent** (`career_assessment`) - Sophie
- **Resume Builder Agent** (`resume_builder`) - Sophie
- **LinkedIn Optimizer Agent** (`linkedin_optimizer`) - Sophie
- **Networking Strategy Agent** (`networking_strategy`) - Sophie

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Multi-User Support
- **User ID Integration**: All conversations are isolated by user ID
- **Thread Management**: Conversations tracked as `{user_id}_{coach_id}`
- **Memory Isolation**: Each user maintains separate conversation history

### Core Components

```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file with required configuration:

```bash
# LLM Configuration
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
GROQ_LLM_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile

# Database
MONGO_URI=mongodb://philoagents:philoagents@local_dev_atlas:27017/?directConnection=true
MONGO_DB_NAME=ai_agents

# Monitoring (Optional)
COMET_API_KEY=your_comet_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### 2. Test the System

```bash
# Test basic functionality
python test_career_coaches.py

# List available coaches
python tools/list_career_coaches.py

# Test a conversation
python tools/call_career_coach.py \
  --coach-id career_assessment \
  --user-id user_001 \
  --query "I need help with my career direction"
```

### 3. Start the API

```bash
# Combined API (includes both PhiloAgents and Career Coaches)
python src/main.py

# Career Coaches only
